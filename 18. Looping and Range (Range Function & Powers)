# The Range() Function

# Google: The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
# We can also specify a start and stop point for range
for x in range(2,9):
  print(x)
print( )
# A third argument will specify the step size.
# Even number between 2 and 20:
for x in range(2,21, 2):
  print(x)
print( )
# Multiples of 5 between 5 and 100
for x in range(5,101,5):
  print(x)
