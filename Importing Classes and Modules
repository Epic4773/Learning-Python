# A module is a file containing code. Here's how to import a class from a module.
from car import Car
new_car = Car('Nissan','Rouge',2021)
print(new_car.describe_car()) 

print()
# We can also import classes using an alias.
from car import ElectricCar as EC
car_2 = EC('Tesla','Model Y',2020)
print(car_2.describe_car()) 
car_2.add_fuel(10)
car_2.battery.charge_battery(50)
car_2.show_range()

# We wouldn't normally have repeat import statements, but these notes are going to show other ways to write import statements.

#We can import two classes at once:
from car import Car, ElectricCar

# ... and use an alias
from car import Car as C, ElectricCar as EC

print()
# or you can simply import the whole module
import car
# and then reference the classes from the car module
car_3 = car.Car('Honda','Civic',2018)
car_3.add_miles(30000)
car_3.show_miles()

print()
# There are many modules available in the Python Standard Library, like the random module we've used before. Here's the randint method from random:
from random import randint
print(randint(1,6))

from random import choice
players = ['daniel','josh','abigail','mary','eli']
first_up = choice(players)
print(first_up)
