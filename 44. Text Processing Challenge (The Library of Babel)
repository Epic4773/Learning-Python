# Use the following link to make a seperate file called "library_of_babel.txt": https://github.com/Epic4773/Learning-Python/blob/main/The_Library_of_Babel.txt

# Download the text file for The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges (on Google Classroom) and upload it OR copy and paste it into a text file on Replit.
# Then, write code in order to compute the answers to the following questions (make use of the split, and strip String methods and the len function for these).
# NOTE: Each question is more difficult than the last. See how far you can get!
