# First Example
import requests as req
filename = "alice_in_wonderland.txt"
foldername = "text_files"
filepath = foldername+"/"+filename
url = "https://gutenberg.org/files/35688/35688.txt"
# this will give us "text_files/alice_in_wonderland.txt" for the file path

try:
  with open(filepath) as file:
    contents = file.read()
except:
  response = req.get(url)
  with open(filepath,'wb+') as file:
    file.write(response.content)
    contents = file.read()

words = len(contents.split())
print(f"There are approximately {words} words in {filename}")

# Second Example
filename = "wonderful_wizard_of_oz.txt"
foldername = "text_files"
filepath = foldername+"/"+filename
url = "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55/55-0.txt"

try:
  with open(filepath) as file:
    contents = file.read()
except:
  response = req.get(url)
  with open(filepath,'wb+') as file:
    file.write(response.content)
    contents = file.read()

words = len(contents.split())
print(f"There are approximately {words} words in {filename}")
