# Download the text file for The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges (on Google Classroom) and upload it OR copy and paste it into a text file on Replit.
# Then, write code in order to compute the answers to the following questions (make use of the split, and strip String methods and the len function for these).
# NOTE: Each question is more difficult than the last. See how far you can get!

print('1. How many lines of text are in Library_of_Babel.txt?')
print('191')
print()

print('2. How many sentences are there in the short story?')
print('Answer')
print()

print('3. How many times does the word “infinite” appear in the short story? How about the word “hexagon”?')
print('Answer')
print()

print('4. What is the average sentence length (both average number of words and average number of characters in a sentence)?')
print('Answer')
print()

print('5. Can you think of something else that might be fun/interesting to compute from the story using Python?')
print('Answer')
print()

#with open('library_of_babel.txt') as file_object:
#  contents = file_object.read()
#print(contents)
