### main.py will be empty

### If you're going to use Replit for this, instead of opening a Python repl template, open a pygame Repl template.

### The following goes into "alien_invasion.py" under an "alien_invasion" folder:
import sys

import pygame

from settings import Settings
from ship import Ship

class AlienInvasion:
  """Overall class to manage game assets and behavior."""
  
  def __init__(self):
    """Initialize the game, and create game resources."""

      (self.settings.screen_width, self.settings.screen_height))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Invasion")

    self.ship = Ship(self)

    # Set the background color.
    self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)
    
  def run_game(self):
    """Start the main loop for the game."""
    while True:
      # Watch for keyboard and mouse events.
      for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
          sys.exit()

      # Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.
      self.screen.fill(self.settings.bg_color)
      self.ship.blitme()
      
      # Make the most recently drawn screen visible.
      pygame.display.flip()
      self.clock.tick(60)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Make a game instance, and run the game.
  ai = AlienInvasion()
  ai.run_game()

### The following goes into "settings.py" under the "alien_invasion" folder:
class Settings:
  """A class to store all settings for Alien Invasion."""
  def __init__(self):
    """Initialize the game's settings."""
    # Screen settings
    self.screen_width = 1200
    self.screen_height = 800
    self.bg_color = (230, 230, 230)

### Make a folder under the "alien_invasion" folder called "images".

### Upload any spaceship you prefer and label it "ship.bmp" under the "images" folder.

### The following goes into "ship.py" under the "alien_invasion" folder:
import pygame

class Ship:
  """A class to manage the ship."""
  
  def __init__(self, ai_game):
    """Initialize the ship and set its starting position."""
    self.screen = ai_game.screen
    self.screen_rect = ai_game.screen.get_rect()
    
    # Load the ship image and get its rect.
    self.image = pygame.image.load('images/ship.bmp')
    self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
    
    # Start each new ship at the bottom center of the screen.
    self.rect.midbottom = self.screen_rect.midbottom
    
  def blitme(self):
    """Draw the ship at its current location."""
    self.screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
