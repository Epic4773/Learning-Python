# Directions: Use "num_list" and "sentence" respectively to complete the challenges in this assignment. Use for loops to complete the challenges, and write tour code and output below each challenge prompt.
# ***Format the output (print statement) of your answer so that it is nice and readable! We've been using the f' ' method in class to do that lately.

total = 0
for num in num_list:

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
# Challenge 5 -- Write a for loop that takes the above sentence and prints out all of the words in the sentence in alphabetical order. Bonus: Can you write a generic loop that accepts a sentence from user input and will work for ANY sentence the user might type?
sentence = sentence.lower()
sentence = sentence.replace('.','')
