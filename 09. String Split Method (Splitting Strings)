# The String Split method cuts up a string into smaller strings, and it cuts where you tell it to cut based on what you input
string1 = 'Computer Science'
word1, word2 = string1.split(' ')
# In Python, we can assign multiple variables at once like word1 and word2 above.
print(word1)

print(' ')

string2 = 'Cat, Dog, Bird'
cat, dog, bird = string2.split(', ')
